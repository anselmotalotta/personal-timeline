CRITICAL FIX: Volume Mount Path Corrected
================================================================================

ISSUE: Docker containers couldn't access Facebook data because:
  - docker-compose.yml was mounting: ./MyData
  - This resolved to: ~/workspace/FacebookPostDownloader/personal-timeline/MyData/
  - But actual data is at: ~/workspace/FacebookPostDownloader/MyData/

FIX APPLIED:
  Changed all volume mounts from:
    - ./MyData:/app/MyData
  To:
    - ../MyData:/app/MyData

This goes up one directory level to access the real MyData folder.

AFFECTED SERVICES:
  ✅ frontend (line 11)
  ✅ qa (line 28)  
  ✅ backend (line 44)

================================================================================
NEXT STEP - NO REBUILD NEEDED:
================================================================================

Since volume mounts are runtime configuration (not build-time), you only need:

  docker compose down
  docker compose up -d

Then watch logs:

  docker compose logs -f

================================================================================
WHAT TO EXPECT:
================================================================================

Backend should now show:
  ✅ "Using path: /app/MyData/facebook"
  ✅ "All json files in path: [list of files]"
  ✅ "Processing 2 photos..."
  ✅ "✅ Main workflow completed successfully"

Frontend should:
  ✅ Start successfully (ajv issue still needs fixing separately)
