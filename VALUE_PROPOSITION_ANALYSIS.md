## 🧠 The Problem It Solves

- **Lost Connections**: Can't see patterns across different life activities

### After Personal Timeline:
- **Unified View**: All your digital life in one chronological timeline
- **Contextual Memory**: Photos with location, time, and related activities
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions like "Show me photos from my last trip to Japan"
